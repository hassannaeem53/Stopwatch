row.
The first row of the display memory will show the digits of a stopwatch and every time spacebar
is pressed, the snapshot of the stopwatch will be taken and it will be printed on the second row of
the display memory. It will keep taking snapshot each time a spacebar is pressed and print it on
next row until it reaches the last row. After that, it will start over-writing from second row.
